# ASPNETGenerator

I still do a lot of work at my job in ASPX Web Forms and it got really time consuming to actually go and manually build each form on every page. There's just so much that's so repetitive about it (as you'll see here) that in most cases, I realised I could just copy from page to page without losing a lot of functionality. So I figured, why go through that when I basically write code to do it for me; you know, seeing as how ASPX Web Forms doesn't have View Scaffolding from Model the way later tech like MVC does).

Since this is mostly a project for my own benefit, I've taken a more casual approach to wording and such; yes it's on my portfolio but it's not really intended as anything more than a way for me to be lazy. For this reason, the writing on this site is a little more colorful than you'd expect to see in a strictly professional system.

If you're here because you'd like to use this to generate your own forms, you probably need to rethink your life choices. I'm under contractual obligation to use this ancient technology; what's your excuse? Anyway I suppose you probably want to know how to do it right? Well fuck off over to Get Started.
